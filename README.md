# chips-and-circuits
Microchips, like those in your PC, consist of a circuit with connected gates. Short connections convey information swiftly and cost only little material.

In this assignment, the chips are all but finished: a circuit is provided with gates in place and the netlist specifies which gates to connect.

Our mission is to arrange the totality of nets between all connectable gates in the shortest manner possible. This results in cheap and fast chips!
